Key approaches include setting precise resource requests and limits, leveraging autoscaling, right-sizing nodes, optimizing storage, and using cost-effective instance types. Below are actionable strategies supported by industry best practices.</p>

<h2 id="resource-allocation-and-limits">Resource Allocation and Limits</h2>
<p>Set precise CPU and memory <strong>requests</strong> to ensure pods receive adequate resources, and define <strong>limits</strong> to prevent excessive consumption that affects other workloads. Under-provisioning risks performance issues, while over-provisioning wastes resources. Tools like <strong>Prometheus</strong> or <strong>Kubernetes Metrics Server</strong> help calibrate these values based on actual usage.<br />
Example deployment configuration:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">resources</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">requests</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">memory</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">512Mi"</span>
    <span class="na">cpu</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">500m"</span>
  <span class="na">limits</span><span class="pi">:</span>

    <span class="na">cpu</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">1"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="autoscaling">Autoscaling</h2>
<p>Implement <strong>Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)</strong> to dynamically adjust pod replicas based on CPU/memory utilization or custom metrics. Combine with <strong>Cluster Autoscaler</strong> to add/remove nodes as needed, avoiding idle resources.<br />
Example HPA configuration:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">apiVersion</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">autoscaling/v2</span>

<p>By combining these techniques—fine-grained resource control, dynamic scaling, infrastructure optimization, and proactive monitoring—Kubernetes environments achieve peak performance while minimizing costs. Continuous iteration based on metrics ensures sustained efficiency as workloads evolve.</p>

<p>##FAQ</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are the most effective ways to balance resource requests and limits in my cluster?</li>
</ol>

<p>Balancing resource requests and limits in your Kubernetes cluster is essential for efficient resource utilization, application stability, and cost control. Here are the most effective strategies and best practices:</p>

<h2 id="rightsize-requests-and-limits-based-on-actual-usage">Rightsize Requests and Limits Based on Actual Usage</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitor real-world resource usage</strong>: Use Kubernetes monitoring tools (like Prometheus, Metrics Server, or cloud-native solutions) to gather data on CPU and memory consumption. Set requests and limits based on observed usage, not guesses or defaults.</li>
  <li><strong>Iteratively adjust</strong>: Start with conservative estimates, deploy, monitor, and incrementally tune requests and limits to match actual needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-memory-requests-equal-to-limits-when-appropriate">Set Memory Requests Equal to Limits (When Appropriate)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For memory</strong>, it’s often best to set requests and limits to the same value. This avoids unexpected container terminations due to memory spikes and ensures predictable memory allocation, reducing fragmentation and OOM (Out of Memory) errors.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="be-cautious-with-cpu-limits">Be Cautious with CPU Limits</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid unnecessary CPU limits</strong>: Setting CPU limits can throttle application performance, especially for bursty workloads. Prefer setting CPU requests only, allowing applications to use extra CPU when available, unless you need strict isolation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-horizontal-pod-autoscaling-hpa">Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Implement HPA</strong>: Use HPA to automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. This helps handle variable workloads without over-provisioning resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="align-with-workload-priority-and-node-capacity">Align with Workload Priority and Node Capacity</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prioritize critical workloads</strong>: Assign higher requests and limits to mission-critical applications, and lower values to less important or batch jobs[3].</li>
  <li><strong>Consider node resources</strong>: Ensure requests are set so that pods can be efficiently scheduled across nodes, avoiding underutilization or scheduling failures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-limitranges-and-resourcequotas">Use LimitRanges and ResourceQuotas</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Namespace-level controls</strong>: Apply LimitRanges to set default/minimum/maximum resource requests and limits for all pods in a namespace. Use ResourceQuotas to cap total resource usage per namespace, ensuring fair resource sharing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leverage-kubernetes-quality-of-service-qos-classes">Leverage Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) Classes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>QoS classes</strong>: Set requests and limits to influence pod QoS (Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort). Use Guaranteed for critical apps (requests = limits), Burstable for flexible apps, and BestEffort for non-critical workloads.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="regularly-review-and-update">Regularly Review and Update</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Continuous optimization</strong>: Application needs change over time. Periodically review resource usage and adjust requests and limits to maintain optimal performance and cost-efficiency.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rightsize-based-on-actual-usage">Rightsize Based on Actual Usage</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitor real consumption</strong> using tools like Prometheus or Kubernetes Metrics Server to set requests at or slightly above average usage (e.g., adding a 15% buffer to observed peaks).</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid static defaults</strong>: Iteratively adjust values through load testing and observability, avoiding over-provisioning (resource waste) or under-provisioning (performance degradation).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="memory-set-requests-equal-to-limits">Memory: Set Requests Equal to Limits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prevent OOM terminations</strong>: Equal memory requests and limits ensure predictable allocation, reducing fragmentation and unexpected pod kills.</li>
  <li><strong>Example configuration</strong>:
    <div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">resources</span><span class="pi">:</span>

</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cpu-avoid-strict-limits">CPU: Avoid Strict Limits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Minimize throttling</strong>: CPU limits can artificially cap performance during bursts. Prefer setting requests only, allowing pods to access idle CPU resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Exception</strong>: Use limits for noisy-neighbor isolation in multi-tenant clusters.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enforce-namespace-level-controls">Enforce Namespace-Level Controls</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ResourceQuotas</strong>: Cap aggregate CPU/memory per namespace to prevent resource monopolization.</li>
  <li><strong>LimitRanges</strong>: Define default requests/limits per namespace to enforce consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="leverage-autoscaling-and-qos">Leverage Autoscaling and QoS</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)</strong>: Dynamically scale replicas based on CPU/memory utilization, maintaining stability during traffic spikes[2][6].</li>
  <li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>: Prioritize critical apps with <strong>Guaranteed</strong> (requests=limits) and non-critical with <strong>Burstable</strong> (requests&lt;limits).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="continuous-optimization">Continuous Optimization</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Audit unused resources</strong>: Regularly clean up orphaned PVs, idle pods, or stale services.</li>
  <li><strong>Automate rightsizing</strong>: Use tools like Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) or Goldilocks to adjust requests/limits based on usage trends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementing these practices—precise rightsizing, memory consistency, CPU flexibility, and automated scaling—creates a resilient cluster where applications receive guaranteed resources without contention. Continuous monitoring and adjustment sustain stability as workloads evolve.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How can I analyze historical data to set optimal requests and limits?</li>
</ol>

<p>To set optimal Kubernetes resource requests and limits using historical data, follow these steps:</p>

<h2 id="1-collect-historical-resource-usage-data">1. Collect Historical Resource Usage Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Metrics Server, or cloud solutions to gather detailed CPU and memory usage metrics over time for each workload.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have a representative dataset that covers typical and peak usage periods, as application behavior may vary with load and time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-analyze-usage-patterns">2. Analyze Usage Patterns</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Examine metrics dashboards or reports to identify average, peak, and percentile-based usage (e.g., 95th or 99th percentile).</li>
  <li>Look for periodic spikes and sustained high or low usage to understand workload characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-calculate-requests-and-limits">3. Calculate Requests and Limits</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Requests:</strong> Set CPU and memory requests based on the average or slightly above-average usage, often using the 95th or 99th percentile for production workloads to ensure stability during peaks.</li>
  <li><strong>Limits:</strong> Set limits higher than requests to allow for temporary bursts, but not so high as to risk resource contention. For memory, some recommend setting requests equal to limits for predictability and to avoid OOM kills.</li>
  <li>Add a buffer (e.g., 20–60%) above observed peaks for highly available or critical applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-validate-and-iterate">4. Validate and Iterate</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Deploy changes and monitor the impact on application performance and cluster stability.</li>
  <li>Adjust values as needed based on new data and evolving workload patterns[2][4][5].</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-automate-with-tools">5. Automate with Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to automatically recommend or adjust requests and limits based on historical usage.</li>
  <li>Leverage cost and efficiency tools (e.g., CAST AI, KubeSphere) for tailored recommendations and ongoing optimization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example-workflow">Example Workflow</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Export CPU/memory usage for the past 2–4 weeks.</li>
  <li>Calculate the 95th percentile for each metric.</li>
  <li>Set requests to the 95th percentile value.</li>
  <li>Set limits to 1.5–2x the request (or equal for memory if stability is critical).</li>
  <li>Monitor and refine as workload or usage patterns change.</li>
</ol>

<p>By systematically analyzing historical data and iteratively tuning your resource settings, you can ensure optimal performance, prevent resource waste, and maintain cluster stability.</p>]]></content><author><name>Shyam Mohan</name></author><category term="Kubernetes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key approaches include setting precise resource requests and limits, leveraging autoscaling, right-sizing nodes, optimizing storage, and using cost-effective instance types.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/optimize-kubernetes-for-performance.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/optimize-kubernetes-for-performance.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Best practice for Running Cost Optimized Kubernetes Applications on GKE</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2025-06-23-best-practice-for-running-cost-optimized-kubernetes-applications-on-gke/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Best practice for Running Cost Optimized Kubernetes Applications on GKE" /><published>2025-06-23T12:55:00+05:30</published><updated>2025-06-23T12:55:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2025-06-23-best-practice-for-running-cost-optimized-kubernetes-applications-on-gke</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2025-06-23-best-practice-for-running-cost-optimized-kubernetes-applications-on-gke/"><![CDATA[<p>Kubernetes has transformed the way applications are deployed and managed at scale.

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Kubernetes has transformed the way applications are deployed and managed at scale. But as organizations embrace Kubernetes, particularly through managed services like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), they face a common challenge: rising cloud costs.</p>

<p>This guide walks you through Kubernetes cost optimization on GKE, providing actionable strategies to reduce your spend without sacrificing performance or scalability.</p>

<h2 id="2-why-cost-optimization-matters-on-gke">2. Why Cost Optimization Matters on GKE</h2>

<p>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) offers flexibility and scalability but comes at a price. Without careful planning, costs can quickly spiral out of control due to underutilized resources, poor workload planning, or misconfigured clusters.</p>

<p>Key reasons to optimize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prevent budget overruns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improve resource utilization</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increase ROI on your cloud investment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build sustainable and scalable infrastructure</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-core-cost-drivers-in-kubernetes-on-gke">3. Core Cost Drivers in Kubernetes on GKE</h2>

<p>Before diving into solutions, let’s understand the primary cost drivers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Node usage (vCPUs, memory, GPU)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Persistent volumes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Load balancers and ingress controllers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Networking egress charges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Autoscaling misconfigurations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-best-practices-for-gke-cost-optimization">4. Best Practices for GKE Cost Optimization</h2>

<h3 id="-right-sizing-workloads">🔹 Right-Sizing Workloads</h3>

<p>Over-provisioning is one of the biggest cost culprits. Use real-time monitoring tools to analyze actual CPU and memory usage, then adjust requests and limits accordingly.</p>

<p>Tools: Prometheus, GKE Metrics Server, Goldilocks</p>

<h3 id="-enable-autoscaling">🔹 Enable Autoscaling</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adjusts the number of nodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Scales pods based on CPU/memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): Adjusts container resource limits dynamically.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: Combine HPA + VPA + Cluster Autoscaler for intelligent scaling.</p>

<h3 id="-choose-the-right-machine-type">🔹 Choose the Right Machine Type</h3>

<p>Use custom machine types to avoid overpaying for generic resources. If workloads are memory-intensive but not CPU-bound, configure VM shapes accordingly.</p>

<p>Tip: Use cost-effective E2 instances for test/staging clusters.</p>

<h3 id="-use-preemptible-vms-or-autopilot-mode">🔹 Use Preemptible VMs or Autopilot Mode</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Preemptible VMs are 80% cheaper but short-lived. Ideal for stateless, fault-tolerant workloads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GKE Autopilot abstracts away node management and charges per pod, reducing idle costs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-set-proper-resource-requests-and-limits">🔹 Set Proper Resource Requests and Limits</h3>

<p>Avoid default settings. Set requests based on average usage and limits to cap unexpected spikes.</p>

<p>Bad practice: Setting both too high wastes resources. Too low can lead to pod eviction.</p>

<h3 id="-efficient-use-of-persistent-storage">🔹 Efficient Use of Persistent Storage</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use SSD only when necessary (e.g., low-latency DBs)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regularly clean up unused Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use filestore for shared workloads instead of duplicating volumes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-implement-namespace-and-labeling-strategy">🔹 Implement Namespace and Labeling Strategy</h3>

<p>Namespaces and labels make it easier to allocate and analyze cost per team, environment, or service.</p>

<p>Use tools like Kubecost or GCP Cost Allocation to link costs with labels.</p>

<h3 id="-detect-and-manage-idle-resources">🔹 Detect and Manage Idle Resources</h3>

<p>Stale pods, services, and namespaces accumulate cost over time. Schedule regular cleanups.</p>

<p>Use: kubectl top pods, kubectl get all –all-namespaces + custom scripts.</p>

<h3 id="-cost-aware-cicd-pipelines">🔹 Cost-Aware CI/CD Pipelines</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Run build/test jobs on preemptible nodes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Ephemeral environments that auto-shutdown after PR testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid keeping preview apps running indefinitely</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-use-monitoring-and-visibility-tools">🔹 Use Monitoring and Visibility Tools</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GCP Cloud Monitoring for node/pod metrics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kubecost for workload-level cost visibility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GKE Usage Metering to see which workloads consume most resources</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-budgeting-and-alerts-with-gcp">5. Budgeting and Alerts with GCP</h2>

<p>GCP offers powerful tools for setting budgets and monitoring cost thresholds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Set budgets per project or per label</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enable alerting on budget thresholds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use Billing Exports + BigQuery for custom reports</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-real-world-case-study-cutting-costs-by-40">6. Real-World Case Study: Cutting Costs by 40%</h2>

<p>A mid-size SaaS company running a multitenant B2B app on GKE optimized their clusters by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Switching dev/staging workloads to preemptible nodes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reducing CPU requests by 30% using Goldilocks recommendations</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Kubernetes has become the go-to container orchestration platform for deploying and managing cloud-native applications. One of its core responsibilities is pod scheduling, the process of placing pods onto nodes in a cluster. While Kubernetes does a great job out-of-the-box, striking the right balance between cost efficiency and resilience requires a thoughtful, strategic approach.</p>

<p>Organizations today aim to reduce infrastructure costs without compromising on performance or availability. This article explores how Kubernetes pod scheduling works, the key features available to control scheduling behavior, and how to optimize your strategy for both cost and resilience.</p>

<h2 id="2-understanding-kubernetes-pod-scheduling">2. Understanding Kubernetes Pod Scheduling</h2>

<p>Pod scheduling is handled by the Kube-scheduler, a component of the Kubernetes control plane. It evaluates a set of scheduling policies and constraints before deciding which node a pod should run on. The process includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Filtering: Identifying nodes that meet the basic requirements (CPU, memory, affinity rules).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scoring: Ranking nodes based on defined preferences (resource usage, spread policies).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Binding: Assigning the pod to the selected node.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The scheduler ensures optimal placement for load balancing, node health, and performance—but it needs configuration and tuning to account for business goals like cost minimization and application resilience.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-trade-off-cost-vs-resilience">3. The Trade-Off: Cost vs Resilience</h2>

<p>Cost optimization often involves consolidating workloads on fewer or cheaper nodes (like spot instances), which can risk availability. On the other hand, resilience demands spreading workloads across availability zones, reserving spare capacity, and using more stable (but costlier) compute types.</p>

<p>The challenge is to find a middle ground—using scheduling techniques and policies to optimize both dimensions without sacrificing the other.</p>

<h2 id="4-key-factors-influencing-pod-scheduling">4. Key Factors Influencing Pod Scheduling</h2>

<h3 id="41-resource-requests-and-limits">4.1 Resource Requests and Limits</h3>

<p>Setting appropriate CPU and memory requests/limits helps the scheduler make efficient decisions. Over-provisioning wastes resources; under-provisioning can lead to throttling or eviction.</p>

<h3 id="42-node-affinity-and-anti-affinity">4.2 Node Affinity and Anti-Affinity</h3>

<p>Node affinity lets you define soft or hard rules for where pods should or shouldn’t run based on node labels (e.g., instance type, region, GPU availability).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution (soft)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution (hard)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Anti-affinity helps avoid placing similar pods on the same node.</p>

<h3 id="43-taints-and-tolerations">4.3 Taints and Tolerations</h3>

<p>Taints mark nodes to repel certain pods. Tolerations allow pods to bypass taints. This helps segregate workloads—for instance, isolating high-priority services from batch jobs.</p>

<h3 id="44-topology-spread-constraints">4.4 Topology Spread Constraints</h3>

<p>Used to evenly distribute pods across different topology domains (zones, nodes, racks). This is key for availability and fault tolerance.</p>

<h3 id="45-priority-and-preemption">4.5 Priority and Preemption</h3>

<p>Pods can be assigned priorities. In resource-constrained environments, lower-priority pods can be evicted to make room for critical ones. This ensures uptime for essential workloads.</p>

<h2 id="5-strategies-for-cost-effective-scheduling">5. Strategies for Cost-Effective Scheduling</h2>

<h3 id="51-right-sizing-resources">5.1 Right-Sizing Resources</h3>

<p>Conduct regular audits of pod resource requests. Use tools like Goldilocks or VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) to fine-tune requests and avoid resource bloat.</p>

<h3 id="52-leveraging-spot-and-preemptible-nodes">5.2 Leveraging Spot and Preemptible Nodes</h3>

<p>Schedule stateless, fault-tolerant workloads on cheaper spot/preemptible instances. Use node affinity rules to isolate them from critical services.</p>

<h3 id="53-autoscaling-clusters-smartly">5.3 Autoscaling Clusters Smartly</h3>

<p>Use Cluster Autoscaler to add/remove nodes based on pending pods and utilization. Combine with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for dynamic right-sizing.</p>

<h3 id="54-scheduling-on-cost-aware-node-pools">5.4 Scheduling on Cost-Aware Node Pools</h3>

<p>Use labels to separate nodes by cost category (e.g., cost-tier=low). Schedule non-critical pods on low-tier nodes using affinity.</p>

<h2 id="6-strategies-for-high-resilience-scheduling">6. Strategies for High Resilience Scheduling</h2>

<h3 id="61-high-availability-through-spread-constraints">6.1 High Availability Through Spread Constraints</h3>

<p>Use topologySpreadConstraints to spread pods across failure domains. This protects against zone or node-level failures.</p>

<h3 id="62-avoiding-single-points-of-failure">6.2 Avoiding Single Points of Failure</h3>

<p>Ensure multiple replicas of a pod aren’t scheduled on the same node or zone. Combine anti-affinity with spread constraints for maximum impact.</p>

<h3 id="63-using-pod-disruption-budgets-pdbs">6.3 Using Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)</h3>

<p>PDBs ensure a minimum number of pods remain available during voluntary disruptions (like node drain or upgrade), preventing accidental downtime.</p>

<h3 id="64-node-and-zone-affinity-for-redundancy">6.4 Node and Zone Affinity for Redundancy</h3>

<p>Pin critical pods to nodes with better reliability SLAs or across multiple zones for regional redundancy.</p>

<h2 id="7-combining-cost-and-resilience-best-practices">7. Combining Cost and Resilience: Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mix spot and on-demand instances using separate node pools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use priority classes to safeguard critical workloads</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement chaos testing to simulate node failures and improve pod rescheduling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adopt multi-zone clusters with zone-aware scheduling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuously monitor and refine pod distribution with tools like KubeCost and Lens</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="8-advanced-scheduling-tools-and-plugins">8. Advanced Scheduling Tools and Plugins</h2>

<h3 id="81-kubescheduler-plugins">8.1 KubeScheduler Plugins</h3>

<p>Plugins allow custom logic for scoring/filtering nodes. For instance, CapacityScheduling or Cost-aware Scheduling plugins.</p>

<h3 id="82-descheduler">8.2 Descheduler</h3>

<p>The Descheduler rebalances pods after cluster changes. For example, it can evict pods from overused nodes to optimize cost/resilience.</p>

<h3 id="case-1-e-commerce-platform">Case 1: E-commerce Platform</h3>

<p>An online store uses priority classes to run payment services on on-demand nodes, and background sync jobs on spot nodes. Result: 35% cost savings without downtime.</p>

<h3 id="case-2-saas-provider">Case 2: SaaS Provider</h3>

<p>A SaaS company uses topology spread constraints to distribute pods across 3 zones. When one zone failed, only 1/3 of pods were affected, reducing impact significantly.</p>

<h2 id="10-conclusion">10. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Balancing cost and resilience in Kubernetes pod scheduling is an ongoing process. It demands a deep understanding of workload requirements, strategic use of Kubernetes primitives, and observability tools. By using the right combination of affinities, constraints, autoscalers, and node configurations, you can run cost-efficient yet highly available Kubernetes workloads.</p>

<iframe width="700" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpEX7oQFk3M?si=vjT3lioG6Yf0xP_Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Kubernetes can be an incredibly powerful tool for scaling applications, but without proper cost management strategies, expenses can quickly spiral out of control. Here are some best practices to ensure your Kubernetes cluster scales efficiently while keeping costs in check!</p>

<h3 id="1-right-sizing-your-resources"><a href=""></a>1. Right-Sizing Your Resources</h3>

<p>One of the most important aspects of cost
optimization in Kubernetes is right-sizing. If you allocate too many resources
(CPU, memory) to pods, you’ll end up over-provisioning and wasting money.
Conversely, under-provisioning can lead to performance degradation. Finding the
right balance is key!</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) :
Automatically adjust the number of pods in your deployment based on CPU
utilization or custom metrics.</p>

<p>●     
Use Resource Requests and Limits :
Define appropriate CPU and memory requests and limits for your pods to ensure
efficient resource utilization.</p>

<h3 id="2-use-spot-instances-for-cost-savings"><a href=""></a>2. Use Spot Instances for Cost Savings</h3>

<p>If your workload can tolerate
interruptions, utilizing spot instances
(or preemptible VMs in some cloud providers) can result in significant cost
savings. Spot instances are cheaper than regular instances and are ideal for
non-critical, stateless applications.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Combine spot instances with Kubernetes’ node autoscaling to
dynamically adjust the number of nodes based on demand.</p>

<p>●     
Use taints and tolerations to ensure that critical workloads do not get
scheduled on spot instances.</p>

<h3 id="3-optimize-cluster-autoscaling"><a href=""></a>3. Optimize Cluster Autoscaling</h3>

<p>Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts
the number of nodes in your cluster depending on the demand for resources.
Efficient scaling helps avoid over-provisioning and reduces cloud
infrastructure costs.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Configure proper node pool sizes: Set up
different node pools with varying instance types (e.g., large for heavy
workloads, small for lighter tasks).</p>

<p>●     
Monitor cluster resource usage: Use Kubernetes
monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track utilization and make
data-driven decisions on scaling.</p>

<h3 id="4-leverage-cost-management-tools"><a href=""></a>4. Leverage Cost Management Tools</h3>

<p>Using cost management tools helps you
visualize and track your spending more effectively. Many cloud providers offer
native tools for this purpose. Additionally, there are third-party solutions
designed for Kubernetes environments.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Cloud Provider Cost Management: Use tools like
AWS Cost Explorer or Google Cloud Cost Management to monitor
and analyze your cloud spending.</p>

<p>●     
Kubernetes-specific tools: Tools like Kubecost and Kubernetes Cost Analysis allow you to break down your Kubernetes
resource costs by individual services, making cost allocation more transparent.</p>

<h3 id="5-implement-efficient-networking"><a href=""></a>5. Implement Efficient Networking</h3>

<p>Networking costs can quickly accumulate,
especially in a distributed Kubernetes environment. To reduce this, focus on
optimizing network usage and minimizing data transfer between services.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Use internal load balancers instead of public
ones to avoid additional data transfer costs.</p>

<p>●     
Configure network policies to reduce
unnecessary inter-service communication and control traffic flow.</p>

<h3 id="6-monitor-and-set-alerts"><a href=""></a>6. Monitor and Set Alerts</h3>

<p>Constant monitoring is essential for
keeping costs under control. Setting up automated alerts allows you to be
notified when you exceed predefined budget thresholds or if any unusual
behavior is detected in your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Use Prometheus and Grafana to create dashboards and set up cost-related
alerts.</p>

<p>●     
Enable budget alerts from your cloud provider to get real-time
notifications when your usage exceeds the expected amount.</p>

<h3 id="7-continuous-optimization"><a href=""></a>7. Continuous Optimization</h3>

<p>Cost management is not a one-time task
but a continuous process. As your workload and scaling requirements evolve, so
should your approach to managing Kubernetes costs.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Review resource usage periodically: Conduct
regular audits of your Kubernetes workloads and resource utilization to
identify areas of improvement.</p>

<p>●     
Optimize workloads: Review pod definitions and
configurations to ensure that you’re running the most efficient setups.</p>

<h3 id="8-use-multi-tenant-kubernetes-clusters"><a href=""></a>8. Use Multi-Tenant Kubernetes Clusters</h3>

<p>Sharing Kubernetes clusters across
different teams or workloads (multi-tenant clusters) can improve resource
utilization and reduce costs by consolidating workloads on fewer nodes.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Use namespaces and resource quotas: By
dividing the cluster into namespaces, you can control resource usage and
allocate resources per team or application.</p>

<p>●     
Use Network Policies for Isolation: Ensure
tenants are securely isolated to avoid unnecessary contention and ensure proper
resource allocation.</p>

<h3 id="9-leverage-kubernetes-cost-allocation--chargeback-models"><a href=""></a>9. Leverage Kubernetes Cost Allocation &amp; Chargeback Models</h3>

<p>Cost allocation and chargeback models are
crucial when managing Kubernetes at scale, especially in multi-team
environments. By allocating costs based on the resources consumed by different
teams or applications, you can make informed decisions on resource usage.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Chargeback/Showback Models: Create cost
allocation strategies to split the cloud bill proportionally across different
teams, departments, or workloads.</p>

<p>●     
Tag Resources Properly: Label or tag your
Kubernetes resources appropriately (e.g., app=frontend, team=finance). This helps track and allocate costs more easily.</p>

<h3 id="10-container-image-optimization"><a href=""></a>10. Container Image Optimization</h3>

<p>Container image size impacts both
performance and cost. Smaller images not only consume fewer resources when
running but also result in faster startup times and reduced storage costs.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Use smaller base images: Opt for minimal base
images like Alpine Linux to reduce
the size of your container images.</p>

<p>●     
Remove unnecessary dependencies: Strip down
images by removing build tools, cache, or any files that aren’t needed at
runtime.</p>

<h3 id="11-implement-pod-disruption-budgets-pdb"><a href=""></a>11. Implement Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB)</h3>

<p>A Pod Disruption Budget ensures that your
Kubernetes pods are not terminated in large quantities, which helps maintain
application availability during scaling activities (like node drains or
voluntary disruptions).</p>

<p>Best Practices:</p>

<p>●     
Set appropriate PDBs: By setting appropriate
Pod Disruption Budgets, you can ensure that your applications remain resilient
during maintenance events without triggering unnecessary pod scaling.</p>

<p>●     
Automate PDBs via Helm charts: If using Helm
for deployment, automate the creation of Pod Disruption Budgets to align with
your scaling strategy.</p>

<h3 id="12-avoid-over-scaling-in-development-environments"><a href=""></a>12. Avoid Over-Scaling in Development Environments</h3>

<p>Often, development and testing
environments are over-provisioned or scale inappropriately. Scaling these
environments like production clusters leads to unnecessary costs.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Use smaller instance types for dev/test workloads: In non-production environments, use smaller instance types or spot
instances that are less expensive.</p>

<p>●     
Set shorter scaling windows: Configure
autoscalers with more aggressive scaling policies in dev environments to scale
down quickly during low-usage times (e.g., after working hours).</p>

<h3 id="13-optimize-storage-costs"><a href=""></a>13. Optimize Storage Costs</h3>

<p>Storage management can be another source
of inefficiency in Kubernetes, especially when dealing with persistent volumes.
Kubernetes doesn’t automatically optimize storage, so it’s essential to choose
the right storage options to keep costs manageable.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Use volume lifecycle policies: Set policies
for the automatic deletion of unused volumes. Kubernetes Persistent Volume
Reclaim policies can help automate this.</p>

<p>●     
Evaluate storage options: Choose the right
type of persistent storage (e.g., SSDs vs HDDs) based on your workload
requirements, avoiding over-provisioning of high-cost storage for low-demand
applications.</p>

<h3 id="14-utilize-kubernetes-cost-anomaly-detection"><a href=""></a>14. Utilize Kubernetes Cost Anomaly Detection</h3>

<p>Anomaly detection can help you identify
unusual spending patterns or cost spikes in your Kubernetes environment. This
can prevent large, unexpected bills and quickly highlight inefficiencies.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Automated anomaly detection: Use tools like Kubecost or cloud-native services like AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to
automatically detect irregularities in your Kubernetes resource usage and cost.</p>

<p>●     
Implement cost forecasting: Forecast future
costs based on current trends, allowing your team to predict and manage budgets
proactively.</p>

<h3 id="15-embrace-serverless-architectures-when-applicable"><a href=""></a>15. Embrace Serverless Architectures When Applicable</h3>

<p>Not all workloads need to be run on
Kubernetes. For certain types of applications (like microservices or
event-driven apps), you may want to explore serverless or FaaS (Function
as a Service) options.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Evaluate serverless options: Platforms like
AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions allow you to run
workloads without managing servers, potentially reducing costs by eliminating
idle resources.</p>

<p>●     
Hybrid approach: Combine Kubernetes with
serverless architectures for optimized cost savings. For example, Kubernetes
can manage stateful workloads, while serverless handles event-driven or
stateless operations.</p>

<h3 id="16-review-cloud-provider-discounts--reserved-instances"><a href=""></a>16. Review Cloud Provider Discounts &amp; Reserved Instances</h3>

<p>Cloud providers offer cost-saving
programs such as reserved instances
or commitment plans where you can
commit to a specific usage level over a long period in exchange for discounted
rates.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>

<p>●     
Evaluate Reserved Instances: If you can
predict your usage, consider committing to reserved or savings plan instances
for predictable workloads in your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>●     
Monitor usage and adjust accordingly:
Periodically review reserved instance usage and adjust capacity to avoid paying
for unused resources.</p>

However, managing node autoscaling in Kubernetes has always been a challenge. Traditional Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler (CA) works well in many cases but comes with <strong>limitations</strong> in speed, efficiency, and cost optimization.</p>

<p>As I worked on optimizing <strong>Kubernetes workloads</strong> for production environments, I needed a <strong>better, faster, and more cost-efficient</strong> autoscaling solution. That’s when I discovered <strong>Karpenter</strong>—an open-source, high-performance node provisioning tool for Kubernetes. In this blog, I’ll share why I decided to use <strong>Karpenter</strong>, how it differs from traditional autoscaling solutions, and the benefits it brings to Kubernetes infrastructure.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="understanding-kubernetes-autoscaling"><strong>Understanding Kubernetes Autoscaling</strong></h2>

<p>Before diving into <strong>Karpenter</strong>, let’s briefly discuss <strong>autoscaling</strong> in Kubernetes. There are three main types of autoscaling in a Kubernetes cluster:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)</strong> – Scales the number of pods based on CPU/memory usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)</strong> – Adjusts the CPU and memory limits of individual pods.</li>
  <li><strong>Cluster Autoscaler (CA)</strong> – Scales nodes based on pending pod demands.</li>
</ol>

<p>While <strong>HPA</strong> and <strong>VPA</strong> focus on pod-level scaling, <strong>Cluster Autoscaler (CA)</strong> manages node-level scaling. The <strong>Cluster Autoscaler</strong> works by adding or removing nodes from the cluster based on pod scheduling requirements. However, it has several <strong>drawbacks</strong> that led me to consider Karpenter.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="challenges-with-traditional-kubernetes-cluster-autoscaler"><strong>Challenges with Traditional Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler</strong></h2>

<p>While the <strong>Cluster Autoscaler</strong> is widely used, it has some <strong>limitations</strong>:</p>

<h3 id="-slow-node-provisioning">❌ <strong>Slow Node Provisioning</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Cluster Autoscaler <strong>relies on cloud provider autoscaling groups</strong>, which can take <strong>minutes</strong> to provision new nodes. This delay can lead to <strong>service disruptions</strong> when workloads suddenly spike.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-fixed-instance-types">❌ <strong>Fixed Instance Types</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>CA <strong>pre-defines instance types</strong> in the autoscaling group, limiting flexibility. If your workload requires a specific instance type, you must update the <strong>autoscaling group manually</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-inefficient-resource-allocation">❌ <strong>Inefficient Resource Allocation</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>It scales nodes <strong>based on predefined rules</strong>, which may lead to <strong>over-provisioning</strong> (wasting resources) or <strong>under-provisioning</strong> (causing performance issues).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-lack-of-spot-instance-support">❌ <strong>Lack of Spot Instance Support</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>CA does not natively optimize for <strong>spot instances</strong>, making cost savings difficult for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These challenges led me to explore <strong>Karpenter</strong>, a Kubernetes-native autoscaler that overcomes many of these limitations.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-karpenter"><strong>What is Karpenter?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Karpenter</strong> is an open-source <strong>high-performance autoscaler</strong> that <strong>provisions nodes on-demand</strong> to meet application needs dynamically. Unlike the <strong>Cluster Autoscaler</strong>, which works with autoscaling groups, <strong>Karpenter directly communicates with the cloud provider API</strong> to provision nodes.</p>

<p>It offers <strong>faster, more flexible, and cost-efficient scaling</strong> for Kubernetes workloads. Karpenter was developed by AWS but is <strong>cloud-agnostic</strong> and can work with other cloud providers as well.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-i-chose-karpenter-over-cluster-autoscaler"><strong>Why I Chose Karpenter Over Cluster Autoscaler</strong></h2>

<p>After evaluating <strong>Karpenter</strong> for my Kubernetes infrastructure, I found several key <strong>advantages</strong>:</p>

<h3 id="-1-faster-node-provisioning">✅ <strong>1. Faster Node Provisioning</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike CA, which depends on autoscaling groups, <strong>Karpenter directly requests compute resources</strong> from the cloud provider API.</li>
  <li>Nodes are <strong>provisioned within seconds</strong> instead of minutes, reducing the risk of pod scheduling delays.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-2-intelligent-resource-allocation">✅ <strong>2. Intelligent Resource Allocation</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Karpenter selects the <strong>most efficient instance type</strong> based on <strong>workload requirements</strong> instead of using pre-defined autoscaling groups.</li>
  <li>It ensures <strong>better resource utilization</strong>, reducing the risk of over-provisioning or under-provisioning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-3-native-spot-instance-support">✅ <strong>3. Native Spot Instance Support</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of the biggest reasons I switched to Karpenter is its <strong>native support for Spot Instances</strong>.</li>
  <li>It intelligently provisions a mix of <strong>On-Demand and Spot Instances</strong>, optimizing cost without compromising reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-4-works-with-any-cloud-provider">✅ <strong>4. Works with Any Cloud Provider</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>While Karpenter was initially designed for AWS, it’s <strong>cloud-agnostic</strong> and supports other cloud providers like GCP and Azure.</li>
  <li>This makes it a great choice for <strong>multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-5-automated-node-cleanup">✅ <strong>5. Automated Node Cleanup</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Karpenter <strong>automatically deprovisions underutilized nodes</strong> based on workload demand.</li>
  <li>This helps reduce unnecessary costs and keeps the cluster efficient.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-6-simplified-configuration">✅ <strong>6. Simplified Configuration</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike Cluster Autoscaler, which requires <strong>node groups and scaling policies</strong>, Karpenter only needs a <strong>simple provisioner YAML file</strong> to define scaling behavior.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-i-implemented-karpenter"><strong>How I Implemented Karpenter</strong></h2>

<p>Integrating <strong>Karpenter</strong> into my <strong>AWS EKS</strong> cluster was straightforward. Here’s a high-level <strong>overview of the setup</strong>:</p>

Whether you’re new to Kubernetes or looking to optimize your deployment, this guide will walk you through the key steps to implement Kubernetes and scale your applications efficiently and effortlessly!</p>

<p><strong>1. Understand the Basics: What is Kubernetes?</strong></p>

<p>Before diving into implementation, it’s important to have a solid understanding of what Kubernetes is and how it works. At its core, Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>

<p>●	Pods: The smallest unit of execution in Kubernetes, where your containers run.</p>

<p>●	Nodes: Virtual or physical machines where pods are deployed.</p>

<p>●	Cluster: A collection of nodes that run your applications and services.</p>

<p>●	Deployments: Define the desired state for applications, ensuring that they run and scale as needed.</p>

<p><strong>2. Set Up Your Kubernetes Cluster</strong></p>

<p>The first step in implementing Kubernetes is setting up a cluster. There are a few ways to do this, depending on your infrastructure and preferences.</p>

<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>

<p>●	Managed Kubernetes Services: For a hassle-free experience, use managed Kubernetes services like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). These take care of most of the setup for you.</p>

<p>●	Self-Managed Kubernetes: If you prefer more control, you can set up Kubernetes on your own using kubeadm or install it on virtual machines.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> If you’re new to Kubernetes, consider starting with a managed service to simplify the setup process.</p>

<p><strong>3. Define Your Application and Prepare Containers</strong></p>

<p>Once your cluster is set up, the next step is to define your application and prepare it for deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<p>●	Containerize Your Application: Use Docker or another containerization tool to package your application into containers. Ensure your application is stateless (if possible) for easier scaling.</p>

<p>●	Create Kubernetes Manifests: Kubernetes uses YAML files to define configurations for Pods, Deployments, and Services. Write these files to specify your application’s requirements.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: Leverage Helm for managing Kubernetes applications. Helm simplifies deployment and management by packaging Kubernetes resources into reusable charts.</p>

<p><strong>4. Deploy Your Application with Kubernetes</strong></p>

<p>Now that your application is containerized and defined in Kubernetes manifests, it’s time to deploy it to your cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<p>●	Apply Manifests with kubectl: Use the command kubectl apply -f <manifest-file>.yaml to deploy your application to the Kubernetes cluster.</manifest-file></p>

<p>●	Create Deployments: Kubernetes will automatically create and manage replicas of your application to ensure high availability. Deployments help maintain the desired state of your application, scaling it up or down as needed.</p>

<p>Best Practice: Make sure to define liveness and readiness probes for your application to ensure Kubernetes can monitor and restart your pods when necessary.</p>

<p><strong>5. Scale Your Application with Ease</strong></p>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Kubernetes is its ability to automatically scale applications based on traffic or resource usage. Scaling your application can be done manually or automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<p>Manual Scaling: You can manually scale your deployments by adjusting the replica count in your Deployment YAML file. For example, set the number of replicas to 5 instead of 3 to increase the number of pods running. 
yaml
CopyEdit
spec:
  replicas: 5</p>

<p>●	Auto-Scaling: Kubernetes supports Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), which automatically adjusts the number of pods based on CPU or memory usage. This ensures your application can scale up during peak traffic and scale down when demand decreases.</p>

<p>bash</p>

<p>CopyEdit</p>

<p>kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10</deployment-name></p>

<p>●	Best Practice: Always monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) to set appropriate scaling thresholds for HPA.</p>

<p><strong>6. Load Balancing and Service Discovery</strong></p>

<p>Kubernetes makes it easy to expose your applications and manage traffic with load balancing and service discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<p>Create Services: Use Kubernetes Services to expose your application to the internet. Services allow your pods to communicate with each other and the outside world, abstracting the underlying network complexity.</p>

<p>yaml
CopyEdit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080</p>

<p>●	Load Balancer: In cloud environments, you can use a LoadBalancer service type to automatically provision an external load balancer. Alternatively, Ingress controllers manage HTTP/S traffic routing.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: Use DNS-based service discovery to easily find and connect services in your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p><strong>7. Implement Monitoring and Logging</strong></p>

<p>When scaling applications, it’s important to monitor their health and performance. Kubernetes provides built-in solutions and integrations for monitoring and logging.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<p>●	Install Prometheus &amp; Grafana: Use Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize them. This combination provides detailed insights into your application’s resource usage and performance.</p>

<p>●	Enable Logging: Use tools like Fluentd, ELK stack, or ECK to aggregate logs from your Kubernetes pods. This will help you monitor errors and optimize application performance.</p>
