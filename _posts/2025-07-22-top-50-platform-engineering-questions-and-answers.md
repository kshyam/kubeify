## System Design & Architecture

1. **How do you design a scalable notification system for millions of users?**  
   Implement distributed message queues (like Kafka or RabbitMQ), partition topics by user/region, place cache layers (Redis) for user state, and ensure horizontal scaling.  
   *Example:* An e-commerce platform uses Kafka to relay notifications, with worker services scaling up or down based on queue length, while Redis caches user-device mappings.

2. **How do you implement a distributed logging system?**  
   Use centralized logging (ELK stack or Fluentd), forward logs from all infra to a central location, index for searchability, and offer role-based dashboards.  
   *Example:* Kubernetes pods send logs to Fluentd, which then feeds Elasticsearch. Kibana dashboards visualize errors and trends.

3. **How do you design a load balancer for large-scale web apps?**  
   Deploy cloud-native load balancers (AWS ELB, GCP LB), configure health checks, support sticky sessions when required, and enable auto-scaling.  
   *Example:* A social app on AWS uses ELB to distribute incoming traffic across hundreds of EC2s, bypassing unhealthy nodes automatically.

4. **How do you architect cloud systems for high availability?**  
   Spread resources over multiple zones/regions, use managed failovers, and enable automated backup/replication.  
   *Example:* SaaS analytics runs critical services in US-East and US-West, utilizing RDS cross-region replication and S3 versioned backups.

5. **What are best practices to ensure cloud scalability?**  
   Favor stateless components, leverage load balancers, use distributed databases, decouple services, and integrate CI/CD pipelines.  
   *Example:* Netflix runs stateless microservices and uses auto-scaling behind load balancers to meet changing global demand.

6. **What's the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?**  
   - Horizontal: Add more machines/instances.  
   - Vertical: Upgrade CPU/RAM on existing box.  
   *Example:* Spike in payment API requests launches extra app servers (horizontal), or increases RAM on current VM (vertical).

7. **How does database sharding support scalability?**  
   Partition data (by user ID, geography, etc.) across independent shards to distribute load and enhance parallelism.  
   *Example:* Gaming platform shards user data by region, so each DB handles a subset of users, boosting performance.

8. **How do you build a resilient microservices platform?**  
   Integrate service mesh (Istio), redundancy, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.  
   *Example:* If email service fails, requests queue until resolved without affecting other microservices.

9. **What is a cloud service mesh and why use one?**  
   A service mesh like Istio manages service-to-service traffic, offering secure, observable, and resilient comms via sidecar proxies.  
   *Example:* In Kubernetes, sidecar proxies in each pod auto-encrypt and log all internal traffic.

10. **How do you set up an auto-scaling group and when is it useful?**  
    Configure scaling policies (CPU or request thresholds), auto-provision and terminate instances as needed.  
    *Example:* Retail backend adds 5 EC2s when CPU exceeds 80% to handle peak shopping events.

## Infrastructure, Automation & DevOps

11. **How do you optimize CI/CD pipelines for faster deployments?**  
    Use parallel test execution, Docker layer caching, split pipelines per environment, and automate rollback strategies.  
    *Example:* Jenkins pipelines run parallel build/test jobs and cache Docker layers for changed code only, speeding up releases.

12. **What's your approach to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**  
    Use code-based tools (Terraform, CloudFormation), version infra resources, peer review changes, and enable reproducible environments.  
    *Example:* Terraform scripts define all AWS resources in Git, so environments can be rebuilt or rolled back swiftly.

13. **How do you monitor and respond to performance bottlenecks?**  
    Deploy APM, distributed tracing, log aggregation, and alerts for critical metrics.  
    *Example:* High web response times traced to DB queries using Datadog and fixed by index improvements.

14. **What's the role of automation and DevOps in cloud management?**  
    Automation ensures rapid, reliable, repeatable infra changes; DevOps unifies dev and ops via CI/CD, IaC, and real-time monitoring.  
    *Example:* Ansible scripts automate blue/green deploys, reducing manual errors.

15. **How do you integrate CI/CD with cloud platforms?**  
    Use cloud-native CI/CD tools (AWS CodePipeline), trigger builds from code pushes, test, and deploy automatically.  
    *Example:* GitHub merge triggers AWS CodePipeline, deploying updates to Lambda, with Slack alerts for status.

16. **How do you ensure security in automated deployments?**  
    Secure secrets with vaults, enforce least-privilege IAM, scan configs for vulnerabilities, and encrypt data in transit and at rest.  
    *Example:* Terraform pipelines use AWS Secrets Manager at deploy time and validate S3 bucket permissions.

17. **How do you document platform designs and processes?**  
    Maintain living docs (architecture, runbooks, automation steps) and automate change tracking.  
    *Example:* A Confluence wiki maps services, processes, and support steps for easy onboarding.

18. **How do you maintain and update cloud infrastructure over time?**  
    Scheduled patching, blue/green deployments, continuous monitoring, and automated capacity/usage audits.  
    *Example:* OS updates roll out in phases, updating half of servers while keeping the other half live.

19. **How do you troubleshoot complex infrastructure issues?**  
    Reproduce problem, gather logs/metrics, perform root-cause analysis, refer to runbooks, and document outcomes.  
    *Example:* Latency traced via network capture reveals DNS resolver failure, remediated by updating resolver settings.

20. **Why is version control critical for cloud infrastructure?**  
    It ensures traceability, enables rollbacks, promotes collaboration, and safeguards against accidental changes.  
    *Example:* Deleting a resource by mistake is fixed by reverting to a stable Terraform commit.
