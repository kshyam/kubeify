When most cloud engineers think of migration, the term **"Lift and Shift"** often dominates the discussion. But while this approach works in specific scenarios, it’s far from a one-size-fits-all solution. Organizations moving to the cloud need to evaluate multiple strategies based on their business needs, technical challenges, and long-term goals. This is where the **7Rs Cloud Migration Strategies** come into play.

## Understanding the 7Rs of Cloud Migration

The **7Rs framework** provides a structured approach for migrating applications, workloads, and infrastructure to the cloud. Let's dive deep into each strategy to understand when and how to use them effectively.

### 1️⃣ Rehost (Lift and Shift)
Rehosting, also known as "lift and shift," is a cloud migration strategy where you move an application and its associated data from one environment to another, typically from an on-premises data center to a cloud environment, without redesigning the application. It's like picking up your application and moving it to a new house without changing its furniture or layout.

**Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of rehosting:**

**How it works:**

* **Copy the application:** You create an exact copy of your application, including its code, configurations, and dependencies.
* **Move to the cloud:** You deploy this copy to a cloud environment, often using virtual machines or containers that mimic your existing infrastructure.
* **Minimal changes:** You make little to no changes to the application's architecture or code.

**Benefits of rehosting:**

* **Speed:** Rehosting is often the fastest way to migrate to the cloud since it requires minimal changes.
* **Cost-effective (initially):** It can have lower upfront costs compared to other migration strategies as it avoids extensive development work.
* **Reduced risk:** Since you're not changing the application significantly, there's less risk of introducing new bugs or issues.

**Drawbacks of rehosting:**

* **Doesn't optimize cloud benefits:** You might not fully utilize the cloud's scalability, elasticity, and cost-optimization features.
* **Potential performance issues:** Applications designed for on-premises environments might not perform optimally in the cloud without adjustments.
* **Technical debt:** You might carry over existing technical debt and limitations to the cloud.

**Use cases for rehosting:**

* **Legacy applications:** When you have applications that are difficult or costly to re-architect.
* **Time-sensitive migrations:** When you need to move to the cloud quickly.
* **Initial cloud adoption:** As a first step to gain experience with cloud environments.

**Alternatives to rehosting:**

* **Replatforming:** Making some modifications to the application to better leverage cloud services.
* **Refactoring/Re-architecting:** Redesigning the application to be cloud-native and fully utilize cloud capabilities.
* **Repurchasing:** Replacing the application with a cloud-based SaaS solution.

**Important considerations:**

* **Application dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the cloud environment.
* **Performance testing:** Thoroughly test the application in the cloud to identify any performance bottlenecks.
* **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect your application and data in the cloud.

### 2️⃣ Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)
Replatforming, often referred to as "lift, tinker, and shift," is a cloud migration strategy that involves making some modifications to an application to take advantage of cloud capabilities while minimizing code changes. It's a middle ground between rehosting (lift and shift) and refactoring (re-architecting).

**Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of replatforming:**

**How it works:**

* **Lift:** You move your application to the cloud, similar to rehosting.
* **Tinker:** You make targeted changes to the application to leverage cloud services and features. This might involve:
    * Migrating to managed services (e.g., databases, message queues)
    * Containerizing the application
    * Optimizing configurations for the cloud environment
* **Shift:** You deploy the modified application in the cloud.

**Benefits of replatforming:**

* **Faster than refactoring:** It requires less development effort compared to re-architecting, resulting in quicker migration.
* **Cost-effective:** It can reduce operational costs by leveraging managed services and optimizing resource utilization.
* **Improved performance:** Applications can benefit from cloud-native features like scalability and elasticity.
* **Reduced risk:** It involves less code changes compared to refactoring, minimizing the risk of introducing new issues.

**Drawbacks of replatforming:**

* **Limited optimization:** It might not fully utilize all the cloud's capabilities compared to a fully re-architected application.
* **Potential compatibility issues:** Some modifications might be necessary to ensure compatibility with cloud services.
* **Requires some development effort:** It involves more changes than rehosting, requiring some development resources.

**Use cases for replatforming:**

* **Applications with a solid architecture:** When the application's core design is sound but can benefit from cloud optimizations.
* **Modernizing legacy applications:** When you want to update older applications without a complete rewrite.
* **Migrating to managed services:** When you want to offload operational tasks to cloud providers.

**Alternatives to replatforming:**

* **Rehosting:** For quick migrations with minimal changes.
* **Refactoring:** For fully leveraging cloud capabilities and achieving maximum scalability and performance.
* **Repurchasing:** Replacing the application with a cloud-based SaaS solution.

**Important considerations:**

* **Application dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the cloud environment and the chosen cloud services.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application after making changes to ensure it functions correctly in the cloud.
* **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect your application and data in the cloud.

### 3️⃣ Repurchase (Drop and Shop)
In this approach, an existing application is **replaced** with a SaaS-based solution.

✅ **When to Use:**
Repurchasing, often referred to as "drop and shop," is a cloud migration strategy where you replace your existing on-premises application with a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution.  It's like dropping your old car and shopping for a brand new one.  Instead of moving your existing application to the cloud (like in rehosting or replatforming), you essentially start fresh with a pre-built, cloud-native application.

Here's a detailed look at repurchasing:

**How it Works:**

1. **Identify a SaaS Solution:** You evaluate available SaaS applications that meet your business needs and functional requirements.  This often involves researching vendors, comparing features, and potentially conducting trials.
2. **Migrate Data:** You migrate your data from your existing application to the new SaaS platform. This might involve data transformation, cleaning, and mapping to fit the SaaS application's data model.
3. **Integrate (if necessary):**  You might need to integrate the new SaaS application with other existing systems within your organization. This could involve APIs, webhooks, or other integration methods.
4. **Train Users:** You train your users on how to use the new SaaS application.  This is crucial for successful adoption and realizing the benefits of the new system.
5. **Decommission the Old System:** Once the new SaaS application is up and running and users are trained, you decommission your old on-premises application.

**Benefits of Repurchasing:**

* **Reduced Costs:**  You can often reduce IT infrastructure and maintenance costs by moving to a SaaS model.  You no longer need to manage servers, operating systems, or application updates.
* **Faster Deployment:** SaaS solutions are typically deployed quickly, allowing you to get up and running faster than with other migration strategies.
* **Access to Latest Features:** You automatically gain access to the latest features and updates provided by the SaaS vendor, without having to manage upgrades yourself.
* **Scalability and Elasticity:** SaaS solutions often offer built-in scalability and elasticity, allowing you to easily adjust resources as needed.
* **Focus on Core Business:**  By offloading IT management to the SaaS vendor, your team can focus on core business activities.

**Drawbacks of Repurchasing:**

* **Potential Feature Gaps:** The SaaS solution might not perfectly match all the features of your existing application.  You might have to adapt your processes or accept some feature gaps.
* **Vendor Lock-in:**  You become dependent on the SaaS vendor and their platform.  Switching vendors can be complex and costly.
* **Data Security and Compliance:**  You need to carefully evaluate the security and compliance practices of the SaaS vendor to ensure your data is protected.
* **Customization Limitations:**  SaaS solutions typically offer limited customization options compared to on-premises applications.
* **Integration Challenges:** Integrating the SaaS application with existing systems can sometimes be challenging.

**Use Cases for Repurchasing:**

* **Commodity Applications:**  For applications that are not core differentiators for your business, such as CRM, HR, or email.
* **Legacy Applications with Limited Support:** When your existing application is old and difficult to maintain.
* **When Speed is Critical:**  When you need to migrate to the cloud quickly.

**Alternatives to Repurchasing:**

* **Rehosting (Lift and Shift):**  For quickly moving an application to the cloud without changes.
* **Replatforming (Lift, Tinker, and Shift):**  For making some modifications to the application to leverage cloud services.
* **Refactoring/Re-architecting:** For redesigning the application to be cloud-native.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Requirements Gathering:**  Thoroughly document your requirements before evaluating SaaS solutions.
* **Vendor Evaluation:**  Carefully evaluate potential SaaS vendors, considering factors like features, pricing, security, and support.
* **Data Migration Planning:**  Develop a detailed plan for migrating your data to the new SaaS platform.
* **Change Management:**  Prepare your users for the change and provide adequate training.

💡 **Example:**
Switching from a self-hosted email system to **Microsoft 365** or moving from an in-house CRM to **Salesforce**.

### 4️⃣ Refactor (Re-architect)
Refactoring, also known as re-architecting, is a cloud migration strategy that involves completely redesigning and rewriting an application to take full advantage of cloud-native services and architectures.  It's the most comprehensive and often the most complex migration strategy, but it can also yield the greatest long-term benefits.

**Here's a detailed look at refactoring:**

**How it works:**

1. **Assessment:** You thoroughly analyze your existing application to understand its functionality, dependencies, and limitations.
2. **Design:** You design a new architecture for the application, leveraging cloud-native principles like microservices, serverless computing, and containerization.  This often involves breaking down the application into smaller, independent components that can be deployed and scaled independently.
3. **Development:** You rewrite the application code based on the new architecture.  This might involve using new programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
4. **Testing:** You rigorously test the refactored application to ensure it meets the requirements and performs as expected in the cloud environment.
5. **Deployment:** You deploy the refactored application to the cloud, taking advantage of cloud-native services for deployment, scaling, and management.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

* **Improved Scalability and Elasticity:** Cloud-native architectures enable applications to scale automatically based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.
* **Enhanced Performance:** Refactored applications can benefit from cloud-optimized infrastructure and services, leading to improved performance and responsiveness.
* **Increased Agility:** Microservices and other cloud-native architectures make it easier to develop, deploy, and update individual components of the application, increasing development agility.
* **Reduced Costs (Long-Term):** While refactoring requires a significant upfront investment, it can lead to lower operational costs in the long run due to optimized resource utilization and reduced maintenance overhead.
* **Innovation:** Refactoring provides an opportunity to modernize your technology stack and incorporate new features and functionalities.

**Drawbacks of Refactoring:**

* **High Upfront Cost:** Refactoring requires a significant investment of time, resources, and expertise.
* **Complex and Time-Consuming:** It's the most complex and time-consuming cloud migration strategy.
* **High Risk:** Rewriting the application code introduces the risk of introducing new bugs or issues.
* **Requires Specialized Skills:** Refactoring requires developers with expertise in cloud-native technologies and architectures.

**Use Cases for Refactoring:**

* **Applications with Scalability Challenges:** When the existing application struggles to handle increasing workloads.
* **Applications with Performance Bottlenecks:** When the application's performance is limited by its architecture.
* **Applications Requiring Modernization:** When the application's technology stack is outdated and difficult to maintain.
* **When Long-Term Benefits Outweigh Upfront Costs:** When the organization is willing to invest in a long-term solution that will provide significant benefits.

**Alternatives to Refactoring:**

* **Rehosting (Lift and Shift):** For quickly moving an application to the cloud without changes.
* **Replatforming (Lift, Tinker, and Shift):** For making some modifications to the application to leverage cloud services.
* **Repurchasing (Drop and Shop):** For replacing the application with a cloud-based SaaS solution.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Thorough Planning:** Refactoring requires careful planning and a clear understanding of the application's requirements and goals.
* **Skill Assessment:** Evaluate your team's skills and identify any training or hiring needs.

💡 **Example:**
Breaking a **monolithic** application into **microservices** and deploying it on **AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, or Kubernetes**.

### 5️⃣ Relocate
While "Relocate" isn't one of the commonly cited "6 Rs" of cloud migration (Rehosting, Replatforming, Repurchasing, Refactoring, Retiring, Retaining), it can be a useful way to think about a specific type of cloud migration, especially when dealing with physical infrastructure. 

Here's how we can understand "Relocate" in the context of cloud migration:

**Relocate: Moving Physical Infrastructure**

"Relocate" primarily focuses on the physical movement of your IT infrastructure. This might involve:

* **Moving your data center:** This could be due to factors like expiring leases, better facilities, or cost savings in a new location.
* **Moving specific hardware:** You might move certain servers or network equipment to a colocation facility or a different data center.

**How it Relates to Cloud Migration:**

* **Hybrid Approach:** "Relocate" often plays a role in a hybrid cloud strategy. You might move some of your infrastructure to a different location while keeping other parts on-premises or migrating them to the cloud.
* **Bridge to the Cloud:** "Relocate" can be a stepping stone towards full cloud adoption. By moving your infrastructure to a more modern facility, you can better prepare for future cloud migrations.
* **Not Always Necessary:** In many cases, "Relocate" might not be necessary for cloud migration. You can directly migrate applications and data to the cloud without physically moving your existing infrastructure.

**Considerations for Relocation:**

* **Logistics:** Planning and executing the physical move of IT equipment requires careful coordination and logistics.
* **Downtime:** Minimizing downtime during the relocation process is crucial.
* **Costs:** There are costs associated with moving physical infrastructure, including transportation, installation, and setup.
* **Security:** Ensuring the security of your equipment during and after the relocation is essential.

**When "Relocate" Might Be Relevant:**

* **Data center consolidation:** When you're consolidating multiple data centers into one.
* **Disaster recovery:** When you need to move your infrastructure to a different location for disaster recovery purposes.
* **Edge computing:** When you're deploying infrastructure closer to the edge of the network.

💡 **Example:**
Migrating **VMware workloads** from an on-premises data center to **Google Cloud VMware Engine**.

### 6️⃣ Retire (Decommission)
In the context of cloud migration, "Retire" means decommissioning or shutting down applications or infrastructure that are no longer needed.  It's a crucial part of a successful cloud strategy, as it helps to reduce costs, simplify IT operations, and focus resources on more valuable initiatives.  It's not about moving something; it's about getting rid of it.

Here's a breakdown of "Retire" in cloud migration:

**What it means:**

* **Identify Unused or Underutilized Resources:** This involves assessing your existing applications and infrastructure to find systems that are no longer being used, are redundant, or are underutilized.
* **Decommissioning:** This involves properly shutting down and removing these resources.  This might include:
    * Turning off servers
    * Deleting databases
    * Canceling software licenses
    * Physically removing hardware
* **Documentation:**  It's important to document the retirement process, including why the resource was retired, when it was retired, and any dependencies it might have had.

**Why Retire?**

* **Cost Savings:** Eliminating unnecessary resources can significantly reduce IT costs, including hardware, software, maintenance, and energy consumption.
* **Reduced Complexity:** Retiring unused systems simplifies IT operations and makes it easier to manage your infrastructure.
* **Improved Security:** Reducing the number of systems can improve security by minimizing the attack surface.
* **Resource Optimization:**  Retiring old systems frees up resources (budget, personnel, time) that can be allocated to more strategic initiatives, like cloud migration itself or developing new applications.
* **Environmental Responsibility:**  Retiring hardware reduces energy consumption and e-waste.

**How to Identify Resources for Retirement:**

* **Usage Analysis:** Analyze server utilization, application usage, and other metrics to identify resources that are underutilized or not being used.
* **Dependency Mapping:** Understand the dependencies between different systems to ensure that retiring one resource doesn't negatively impact others.
* **Business Requirements:** Review business requirements to identify applications or systems that are no longer needed to support business processes.
* **Application Portfolio Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of your application portfolio to identify candidates for retirement.

**Considerations for Retirement:**

* **Data Backup:** Ensure that any important data stored on retired systems is properly backed up and migrated to a different location if necessary.
* **Compliance:**  Consider any compliance requirements related to data retention before retiring a system.
* **Communication:** Communicate the retirement plan to all stakeholders, including users and IT staff.
* **Phased Approach:**  Consider a phased approach to retiring systems to minimize disruption.

**Retiring vs. Other Cloud Migration Strategies:**

"Retire" is distinct from the other "R" strategies:

* **Rehosting:** Moving an application to the cloud without changes.
* **Replatforming:** Making some modifications to an application to leverage cloud services.
* **Repurchasing:** Replacing an application with a cloud-based SaaS solution.
* **Refactoring:** Redesigning and rewriting an application for the cloud.
* **Retaining:** Keeping an application on-premises.

"Retire" is about eliminating resources, not migrating them.  It often goes hand-in-hand with the other strategies.  For example, you might refactor some applications, repurchase others, and retire those that are no longer needed.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeMyiAJLqZeQQ7KUrh24U7PEJ-uJF8cFx3kX8wVaKP9NkLqr0RVjcdXYC1GBcu_2BGx73o_4SXKzh8pjxqvUOp3r9iZRLE_vij28PxXAlCjusX7TGgiXQRGZt4ZhUWMi3GmkaDLUg?key=1beB9YyK6sUFfwFz2OxSuA)

💡 **Example:**
Shutting down an **old HR management system** after moving to a modern **cloud-based HR platform**.

### 7️⃣ Retain
In the context of cloud migration, "Retain" means keeping certain applications or infrastructure on-premises, rather than migrating them to the cloud.  It acknowledges that not everything needs to be moved to the cloud, and that some systems might be better suited for an on-premises environment.  It's a deliberate decision based on various factors.

Here's a breakdown of "Retain" in cloud migration:

**What it means:**

* **Analysis and Decision:**  This involves carefully evaluating your existing applications and infrastructure to determine which systems should remain on-premises.
* **Justification:**  There should be a clear justification for retaining a system, based on factors like regulatory requirements, performance needs, security concerns, or cost considerations.
* **Maintenance and Management:**  Retained systems still require maintenance, updates, and ongoing management, even if they're not being migrated.

**Why Retain?**

* **Regulatory Compliance:** Some industries have strict regulations regarding data storage and processing, which might require keeping certain systems on-premises.
* **Data Sovereignty:**  Data sovereignty laws might require that certain data remains within a specific geographic region, making cloud migration challenging.
* **Performance Requirements:**  Some applications might require very low latency or high bandwidth that might be difficult to achieve in the cloud.
* **Security Concerns:**  Organizations might have security concerns about moving sensitive data or applications to the cloud.
* **Cost Considerations:**  In some cases, it might be more cost-effective to maintain certain systems on-premises, especially if they are already well-maintained and have a low total cost of ownership.
* **Legacy Systems:**  Older, legacy systems that are difficult or costly to migrate might be retained until they can be replaced or modernized.
* **Specific Hardware Dependencies:**  Some applications might rely on specialized hardware that is not readily available in the cloud.

**Considerations for Retention:**

* **Ongoing Costs:**  Retained systems still incur costs for hardware, software, maintenance, and IT staff.
* **Technical Debt:**  Retaining older systems can contribute to technical debt, making it more difficult to innovate and modernize.
* **Integration Challenges:**  Integrating on-premises systems with cloud-based applications can sometimes be complex.
* **Security Management:**  Maintaining the security of on-premises systems is an ongoing responsibility.

**Retaining vs. Other Cloud Migration Strategies:**

"Retain" is the opposite of the other "R" strategies that involve moving to the cloud:

* **Rehosting:** Moving an application to the cloud without changes.
* **Replatforming:** Making some modifications to an application to leverage cloud services.
* **Repurchasing:** Replacing an application with a cloud-based SaaS solution.
* **Refactoring:** Redesigning and rewriting an application for the cloud.
* **Retiring:** Decommissioning or shutting down applications or infrastructure.

"Retain" is about *not* migrating. It's a valid and often necessary part of a comprehensive cloud strategy. It's important to make informed decisions about which systems to retain based on a thorough assessment of business requirements, technical considerations, and cost-benefit analysis.  A hybrid approach, where some systems are in the cloud and others are retained on-premises, is a common and often effective strategy.
